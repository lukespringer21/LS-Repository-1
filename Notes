Difference between source and version control
    version control - talking about project as a whole (website - logos, images, documentation, code)
    source control - talking purely about the developmental aspect of the application (just the code)

Companies can copy code from Git
These companies then edit parts of their code
They can have a pull request from the original PM, who can approve it and then add that company's code to the original code on Git
